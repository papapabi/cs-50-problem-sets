# This is CS50

My solutions to Harvard's CS50 problem sets. I mostly do this when I'm in a Project Euler dry spell.

All course material are freely (as in beer) available at https://cs50.harvard.edu.


## Compilation

```sh
$ gcc <filename>.c cs50.c -o <execname> -std=c99
```

## File execution

```sh
$ ./execname
```
